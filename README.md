I had to learn the following web scraping libraries to implement this solution:

`Requests`:req to make a GET call to the target website

`BeautifulSoup4`:[bs4] to parse the HTML received from the call

`PyInstaller`:[install] to produce an executable ready for production

[install]:https://www.pyinstaller.org/
