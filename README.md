# Career Center Event Web Scraper
Python based solution to grab upcoming events from Gonzaga University's [Career Center](https://www.gonzaga.edu/student-life/career-services).  

### Techniques Used
#
I learned the following web scraping libraries to implement this solution:

<a href='http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/'>`Requests`</a> to make a GET call to the target website

<a href='https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/'>`BeautifulSoup4`</a> to parse the HTML received from the call

<a href='https://www.pyinstaller.org/'>`PyInstaller`</a> to produce an executable ready for production
